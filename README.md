This is a small syntax guide for raw Haxe projects. You can link this to anybody who needs help with how to properly format their Haxe code. Flixel-specific version coming soon!

**If you have any suggestions/improvements, feel free to open a PR/Issue! You can also find me as @BSOD on the Haxe Discord server.**

# Compiling

- You only need Haxe's latest version in order to compile this project-- No extra libs needed!

# Extra

Concepts that couldn't be explained in the doc will be explained here.

----------

- Brackets, parentheses and square brackets must **ALWAYS** HAVE PAIRS! Brackets denote the start and end of code blocks (inside functions, classes, etc.). A missing/extra bracket can mess things up. So ALWAYS close them properly. Same goes for conditional compilation blocks.
**VSCode** has built-in **Bracket Pair Colourizer** to help you recognise which brackets match (or not). [Here is a tutorial on how to enable it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw7LJZfhowU)
