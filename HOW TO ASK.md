# Welcome to a guide on social interactions!

You have an issue with your code. You don't know where to begin. You need help to fix it. You pull up to the [Haxe Discord server](https://discord.gg/nEcn45vjqY)...

## But nobody answered?

If your question goes like this:

_"how do i fix this?"_

_"where's the error"_

_"can anybody help me"_

_"this doesn't work"_

Nobody is going to help you.

## Here's why.

The Discord server is a place where you have a determined channel to ask for help about a determined topic. If you have an issue with, say, HaxeFlixel, there's the #flixel channel.
Same for Heaps.IO, same for Ceramic, same for general Haxe questions.

Whatever is the thing you need help with, **PROVIDE INFO!!!**

- "Doesn't work" doesn't mean ANYTHING! Tell us what's happening, and what's the desired outcome, in a way we can understand what's going on.
- "Where's the error?" Sounds lazy and vague! If you're not compromised to solving your own error, why would we?
- "Can anybody help me?" By asking this, you're challenging our confidence on our own skills, and compromising us to respond, which is not what you want to do. [Don't ask to ask!](https://dontasktoask.com/)
just ask.
- "How do I fix this" Is, again, vague and useless. 

## Don't compromise us.

If someone is willing to help you with your problem, they WILL RESPOND! There is no need to ping a specific person to help you (unless that person has something to do with the issue, say, a possible bug).
So:

- Repeating your question again and again in the channels is NOT going to get you help faster and is only annoying spam.
- Pinging unrelated people to answer your question is not cool.
- Do NOT contact people in DMs unless they tell you to do so!! This is annoying and it compromises the person to respond to you. If you don't want to flood the chats, use a thread.
- DMing people prevents others from answering the question, or even getting helped by the answer. 
- Refrain from sending the entire modules (.hx files). We're here to help you understand the errors, **NOT FIX YOUR CODE!** We have jobs, hobbies, and other activities. And some of us
would rather not read hundreds of lines to spot an error that could easily be spotted by the person who wrote it.

## How do I properly format my question?
Programming is a cause and effect system. If an error occurs something you did caused it to occur - keep this in mind when asking a question it is extremely helpful to provide us an account of what you did leading up to the issue, usually what you wrote and/or changed within the last 5-10 minutes of the error presenting itself. This can really help you get solutions faster.

- **Provide code snippets:** Paste some _small_ portions of code that could be related to the error so that we can help you debug further.
- **Show errors:** If you get any errors/stack traces on the console, bingo! We know what the error is and that will speed things up a lot.
- **Ask in the correct channel:** If you're using utils from a certain library/package, ask in the dedicated channel. #tools is a good place for IDE/Setup related issues.


## And overall, BE KIND!

We are all humans and we deserve to be treated with respect! While we're here to help you, remember that we are still busy, not available, or simply as confused as you are!
Be _respecful_, because those are the rules you agreed to when you joined the server!
